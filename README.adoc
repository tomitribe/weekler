= Weekler

A simple application to manage week affectation in a user list.

== How does it work?

Weekler relies on a user list. Each user has an ordinal. When you show a week
weekler will create the week if not already in the database and in the future (= past week are ignored).
One person of the database will be affected to the week (NOTE: ensure to create at least one person).
To select the person weekler will use the next person in the list browsing people in ascending ordinal order.

== Build

[source]
----
mvn clean package
----

== Run

[source]
----
mvn compile tomee-embedded:run
----

Then go on http://localhost:8080/weekler/

== Note

To develop with the project setup keep in mind to exclude scanning from your IDE of folders:

- src/main/frontend/node_modules
- src/main/frontend/js/app/build
- src/main/webapp/js

These files are generated during the build. First one is where npm put the dependencies, the second one
is where we build our app.js (aggregation of our .ts) and last one is where it is copied to be able
to use it with tomee-embedded-maven-plugin and to ensure it is packaged in our .war.

== TODO

=== Tests

- add JAXRS tests
- add frontend tests
