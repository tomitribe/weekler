= Weekler

A simple application to manage week affectation in a user list.

== How does it work?

Weekler relies on a user list. Each user has an ordinal. When you show a week
weekler will create the week if not already in the database and in the future (= past week are ignored).
One person of the database will be affected to the week (NOTE: ensure to create at least one person).
To select the person weekler will use the next person in the list browsing people in ascending ordinal order.
